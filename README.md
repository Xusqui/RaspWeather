IP Anemometer
=============

This is a hardware+software project. A wind sensor is connected to a Raspberry
Pi via the GPIO interface. The Pi collects measurements and uploads them to a
web server, which stores them in a MySQL database. The server shows various
statistics, such as wind speed over time, average, maximum and a histogram.
